    protocol. The document is returned as a string. For example, if
    you use the URL of a website, you'll get the same thing you'd get
    by going to that website in a browser and using the  browser's
    "View Source" function.

    Args:
        url (str): The URL to retrieve.
        connectTimeout (int): The timeout for connecting to the URL.
            In milliseconds. Default is10,000. Optional.
        readTimeout (int): The read timeout for the get operation. In
            milliseconds. Default is 60,000. Optional.
        username (str): If specified, the call will attempt to
            authenticate with basic HTTP authentication. Optional.
        password (str): The password used for basic HTTP
            authentication, if the username parameter is also present.
            Optional.
        headerValues (dict): A dictionary of name/value pairs that
            will be set in the HTTP header. Optional.
        bypassCertValidation (bool): If the target address is an HTTPS
            address, and this parameter is True, the system will
            bypass all SSL certificate  validation. This is not
            recommended, though is sometimes necessary for self-signed
            certificates. Optional.
        useCaches (bool): Will cache the information returned by the
            httpGet call. If using this for something that constantly
            updates like an rss feed, it would  be better to set this
            to False. Default is True. Optional.
        throwOnError (bool): Set to False if you wish to get the error
            body rather than a Python exception if the GET request
            returns an error code (non-200 responsive). Default is
            True. Optional.
